# Project: King County House prices step by step

This is my first project in Data Science. I discoverd the King County House prices data set by using python. 
The folder "Jupyter_Notebook" contains everything you will need to explore my analysis. 
The name of the Jupyter Notebook is "2-Immersive_Data_Science_Project1_EDA". Have fun and remember it's my first try. 

## Preparatory work 
- Import used libraries
- Load Dataset

## 01) Business Understanding
- Have a look at the Dataset
- Understand columns
- What might impact the price?

## 02) Data Mining
- Remove columns without useful informations 
  
  ('id', 'date', 'view', 'sqft_above', 'sqft_basement', 'lat', 'long', 'sqft_living15', 'sqft_lot15')

## 03) Data Cleaning
- Dealing with NAN (delet columns)
- Remove Outlier

## 04) Data Exploration
- Visualize all features by using scatter_matrix
- Visualize interesting features one by one with different diagrams
- Heatmap correlations

## 05) Feature Engineering
- Creating new features by using raw data
- Mean price by zipcode 

## 06) Predictive Modelling
- Multiple Regression Model

## 07) Data Visualization
- Plot relavant informations to transport the message
- Create a map by zipcode

## 08) Future work
- no time to test all of my ideas
- listed some of them at the end of the notebook
